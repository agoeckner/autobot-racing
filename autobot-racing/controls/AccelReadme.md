The Acceleration for this project has been written, but not implemented for the following reasons:
The cars are already too fast, even at their minimum speed setting.
The tracks are too small, causing some cars to lose course when accelerating.
The acceleration code sometimes clashes with the collision code.
	This causes other errors, with cars speeding into the back of each other.
